Project Title: Module 1 Challenge

Description: This repository contains the challenge for our week one bootcamp module, which involed editing pre-existing code to bring it up to accessibility standards. The existing website was for Horiseon SEO & Marketing. The project involved updating semantic HTML elements, ensuring the status of ALT-text for images and icons, and logically structuring the code independent of styling and positioning. 

Included in the repository:
    - 1 READ.me file
    - 1 index.html file containing the edited code
    - 1 style.css sheet, linked to the html file
    - Images folder with 7 images
